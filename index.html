        <h3>Project Synopsis</h3>

        <p>This project is a continuation of the work produced by two previous teams, where the primary goal in this iteration is transitioning from a beta product to a fully-fledged, production-ready piece of software that can be shown to customers. PresenceVR is a virtual reality based web application that allows users to hold interviews with employers online. There is particular focus on occupations that require materials like a portfolio - interviewees can save money on travel and materials by turning the entire interview process into a virtual experience.</p>

        <p>The interviews are conducted in a virtual reality setting that allows the interviewee to create and design a room according to their liking. The interviewer and interviewee can interact with each other in the virtual space. This space may contain artifacts from a portfolio, items of personal interest, or other aesthetic objects relevant to the interview. The interviewer and interviewee can talk with one another in this virtual environment, as well as video chat in a more conventional VoIP scenario. Users without VR gear can still interact with the virtual gallery similar to a first-person video game.</p>

        <p>Development work for this iteration will lie in expanding the types of assets that can be brought into the virtual world, improving user presence and other 3D assets, streamlining the user interface, fully documenting and testing the codebase, optimizing to ensure excellent performance with a multitude of devices, and getting feedback from multiple potential customers. This feedback will likely drive future functional requirements.</p>
